# Global Holiday Calendar

An extensible, lineage-safe, multi-faith holiday calendar with modular adapters, strict validation, and exports (JSON/CSV/ICS).

## Quick start
- Add or modify adapters under `src/adapters/`.
- Place community contributions in `contrib/examples/sample-contrib.json`.
- Run `./scripts/build.sh` to generate `data/holidays.json`, `data/holidays.csv`, `data/holidays.ics`.

## Design
- JSON Schema enforced with Ajv
- Deterministic merging and conflict resolution
- Export to interoperable formats
- Sunset-aware observance fields

## Contributing
- Submit PRs with new holidays via `contrib/examples/*.json`.
- Ensure each entry passes schema validation and includes tradition, scope, and date details.
